# AME556-Robotics-Project
Course project for AME 556 - Robot Dynamics and Control

This repo contains the code for our AME 556 course project. We were asked to design controllers for the Unitree A1 robot in Matlab Simscape for walking, turning, running, stair climbing and obstacle avoidance. Our report detailing the our choice of controllers, gaits, swing trajectories can be found in this [report](AME556_Project_Report.pdf).
