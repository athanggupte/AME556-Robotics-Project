# AME556-Robotics-Project
Course project for AME 556 - Robot Dynamics and Control

This repo contains the code for our AME 556 course project. This project focuses on creating controllers for the Unitree A1 quadruped robot to do various tasks, including walking, running, climbing stairs, and navigating an obstacle course, using MATLAB Simscape. The objective is to develop controllers that allow the robot to carry out these activities successfully and efficiently while conforming to the given specifications and limits. Controllers were designed for walking, turning, stair climbing and obstacle avoidance. The walking activities include walking forward, backward and sideways with a speed ≥ 0.5 m/s and turning in place with a yaw speed of ≥ 0.5 rad/s. Three other controllers were developed for running, stair climbing and obstacle avoidance. 

Our report detailing our choice of controllers and their gains, gaits and swing trajectories can be found in this [report](AME556_Project_Report.pdf)
